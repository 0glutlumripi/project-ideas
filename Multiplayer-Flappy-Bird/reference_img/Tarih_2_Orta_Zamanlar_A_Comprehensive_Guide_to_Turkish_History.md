## Why is Tarih 2 Orta Zamanlar important?
 
Tarih 2 Orta Zamanlar is important for several reasons. First, it is a valuable source of historical information and analysis that reflects the views and values of Turkish scholars and intellectuals in the early 20th century. It provides insights into how they understood and interpreted their own past and identity.
 
Second, it is a product of a nationalistic and modernist project that aimed to create a new Turkish nation-state based on secularism, republicanism and westernization. It was part of AtatÃ¼rk's reforms that sought to transform Turkey from a multi-ethnic and multi-religious empire into a homogeneous and secular nation. It also aimed to promote a sense of pride and patriotism among Turkish citizens by highlighting their historical achievements and contributions to world civilization.
 
Third, it is a controversial and contested book that has been criticized and challenged by different groups and perspectives over time. Some critics have argued that it is biased, inaccurate or incomplete in its representation of Turkish history. Some have claimed that it ignores or marginalizes the role of non-Turkish peoples or religions in Anatolia and beyond. Some have suggested that it glorifies or justifies violence or oppression committed by Turkish rulers or forces. Some have also questioned its relevance or validity in today's globalized and multicultural world.
